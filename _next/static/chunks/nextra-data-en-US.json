{"/docs/acknowledgments":{"title":"Acknowledgments","data":{"":"CH-UI is built on the shoulders of giants. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the creators and maintainers of the following open-source projects that make our work possible:","clickhouse-#ClickHouse ü•áü•áü•á":"ClickHouse: THE ONE AND ONLY! I mean, we wouldn't be here without ClickHouse, right? üòÖ üôè\nI would like to personally thank the ClickHouse team for creating such an amazing database system and for providing excellent documentation. The power, speed, and flexibility of ClickHouse have been truly inspiring, and it has been a joy to work with such a well-designed system.\nThis project has been an incredible learning experience for me. It has allowed me to dive deep into the intricacies of database management and user interface design, pushing me learn from being a Data Engeener to maybe a Developer :) . The journey of creating CH-UI has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm immensely proud of what it has become (and what it can be with the community support and contribution).\nI am very grateful for having the opportunity to make a personal project that can be useful to a wide range of users. Whether you're a curious individual just starting to explore ClickHouse, a data analyst looking for a more intuitive way to interact with your data, or a company seeking efficient data management solutions, I hope CH-UI serves you well. - Caio Ricciuti","core-technologies#Core Technologies":"React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\nTypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.\nVite: Next Generation Frontend Tooling.","state-management#State Management":"Zustand: A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution.","ui-components-and-styling#UI Components and Styling":"Radix UI: An open-source UI component library.\nTailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework.\nLucide React: Beautiful & consistent icons.\nclass-variance-authority: Manage UI variants with less code.\nclsx: A tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally.\ntailwind-merge: Merge Tailwind CSS classes without style conflicts.\ntailwindcss-animate: A Tailwind CSS plugin for creating animations.","database-interaction#Database Interaction":"@clickhouse/client-web: Official ClickHouse JavaScript client.","routing#Routing":"React Router: Declarative routing for React.","data-visualization-and-tables#Data Visualization and Tables":"Recharts: A composable charting library built on React components.\nECharts: A powerful charting and visualization library.\nAG Grid: Advanced Data Grid / Data Table supporting React.\n@tanstack/react-table: Headless UI for building powerful tables & datagrids.","form-handling#Form Handling":"React Hook Form: Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.\nZod: TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.","ui-enhancements#UI Enhancements":"Framer Motion: A production-ready motion library for React.\ncmdk: Fast, composable, unstyled command menu for React.\nSonner: An opinionated toast component for React.\nVaul: Drawer component for React.","code-editing#Code Editing":"Monaco Editor: The code editor that powers VS Code.\n@monaco-editor/react: Monaco Editor for React.\nsql-formatter: A JavaScript library for pretty-printing SQL queries.","utility-libraries#Utility Libraries":"next-themes: Perfect dark mode in 2 lines of code.

Application State Management":"CH-UI utilizes Zustand for efficient and straightforward state management. The central state store forms the backbone of the application's data flow.","key-features#Key Features":"ClickHouse Client Integration: A ClickHouse client instance is maintained in the state, facilitating seamless communication with the ClickHouse server.\nCredential Management: User credentials for ClickHouse are securely stored and managed within the state.\nWorkspace Persistence: The current state of all open tabs and workspaces is maintained, enabling a persistent and responsive user interface.\nState updates are performed using actions defined in the store, allowing components to easily access and modify the application state. This centralized approach ensures consistency across the application and simplifies data flow management.","2-workspace-and-tabs#2. Workspace and Tabs":"The CH-UI workspace is built around a flexible tab system, allowing users to manage multiple queries or views simultaneously.","key-features-1#Key Features":"Dynamic Tab Creation: Users can create new tabs for various content types (SQL queries, information views, etc.).\nTab Persistence: Tabs are persisted using IndexedDB, allowing work recovery across sessions.\nTab Management: Users can reorder, rename, and close tabs as needed.\nThis tab system provides a familiar and efficient interface for users to organize their work. It allows for multitasking and easy navigation between different queries or database views, enhancing productivity in database management tasks.","3-database-explorer#3. Database Explorer":"The Database Explorer provides a hierarchical view of ClickHouse databases and tables, enhancing navigation and data discovery.","key-features-2#Key Features":"Tree Structure: Databases and tables are displayed in an expandable tree structure.\nSearch Functionality: Users can search for specific databases or tables.\nReal-time Refresh: The explorer can be refreshed to fetch the latest database structure.\nThis component serves as the primary navigation tool for users to explore their ClickHouse databases. It provides an intuitive interface for users to understand the structure of their data and quickly access specific tables or databases.","4-query-execution-and-big-data-handling#4. Query Execution and Big Data Handling":"Query execution is a core feature of CH-UI, designed to handle large datasets efficiently.","key-aspects#Key Aspects":"Query Execution: Queries are sent to the ClickHouse server using the @clickhouse/client-web library.\nResult Processing: Query results are processed and stored in the application state or IndexedDB, depending on their size.\nLarge Dataset Management: CH-UI uses a combination of chunked data retrieval, IndexedDB storage, and virtualized rendering for efficient big data handling.","big-data-handling-strategies#Big Data Handling Strategies":"Chunked Data Retrieval:\nLarge query results are retrieved in manageable chunks to prevent memory overflow. This allows the application to handle queries that return massive datasets without overwhelming the browser's memory.\nIndexedDB for Large Datasets:\nQuery results exceeding a size threshold are stored in IndexedDB instead of in-memory state. This strategy enables the application to work with datasets that are too large to fit in memory, providing a seamless experience even with big data.\nVirtualized Rendering:\nLarge datasets are rendered using virtualization techniques, displaying only the visible portion of the data. This significantly improves performance when dealing with tables containing thousands or millions of rows.\nBy implementing these strategies, CH-UI provides a robust solution for working with big data in a web-based ClickHouse client. Users can execute complex queries on large datasets and interact with the results smoothly, making it suitable for data analysis and exploration tasks on substantial ClickHouse databases.These core concepts work together to create a powerful, efficient, and user-friendly interface for ClickHouse database management. The application's architecture ensures smooth handling of large datasets, responsive user interactions, and persistent workspace management, catering to the needs of data professionals working with ClickHouse databases."}},"/docs/getting-started":{"title":"Getting Started with CH-UI üöÄ","data":{"":"Welcome to CH-UI!
