Well, we\'ve crunched the numbers, and the results are in!\\n\\n## The Brooklyn Escape Statistics\\n\\nFrom July 1, 2015 to September 30, 2015, we tracked a whopping **52,075** taxi rides originating from the hipster havens and brownstone-lined streets of Brooklyn. But here\'s the kicker: **989** of these rides were headed straight for the airport!\\n\\n:::tip Fun Fact\\nA full **1.9%** of Brooklyn taxi riders were airport-bound. That\'s nearly 1 in 50 rides!\\n:::\\n\\n## The Great Escape: Theories and Speculations\\n\\nAre they fleeing the artisanal coffee shops? Escaping the never-ending brunch lines? Or just jetting off on another Instagram-worthy adventure?\\n\\nWe may never know the true reason behind this mass exodus, but one thing\'s for sure: Brooklyn might be trendy, but apparently, the trendiest destination of all is... anywhere else!\\n\\n## The Brooklyn Airport Dash: A Modern Urban Legend\\n\\nSo the next time you\'re stuck in Brooklyn traffic, remember: there\'s a 1.9% chance the car next to you is making a desperate dash for JFK. Maybe they forgot to pack their artisanal beard oil, or perhaps they\'re just late for their shift as a professional avocado toast influencer in LA.\\n\\n:::note The Real Miracle of Brooklyn\\nFor many Brooklynites, the real \'Miracle of Brooklyn\' is successfully hailing a cab to the airport!\\n:::\\n\\n## What\'s behind all this madness?\\n\\n> \\"How am I going to cary on with my lide without answers for all my questions about taxi rides in NYC!?

You know ClickHouse, that super-fast database system that can crunch through tons of data like it\'s nothing? Well, CH-UI is basically a fancy dress for ClickHouse. It\'s a UI that makes ClickHouse easy to use via a web browser.\\n\\n## Why did I create it?\\n\\nHere\'s the thing... ClickHouse is amazing, but when you have a project, or a group of people, or even if you want your super unicorn start-up to be able to use \\"BIG-DATA, AI-DRIVEN, DATA-DRIVEN\\" solutions, data needs to be accessible to everyone. Queries need to be easy to write, and results need to be easy to understand, see, and get insights from... ClickHouse itself offers a cloud-based solution, and [I **really** recommend it](https://clickhouse.com/cloud?utm_source=ch-ui&utm_medium=blog). They even give you free credits and **LOTS** of features...\\n\\nAfter using their cloud solution, I was amazed by all the features and the speed of the database, but the time had come. It was 26 days into my trial... The clock was ticking!\\n\\nThen the thought:\\n\\n> \\"How am I going to leave without an answer for my NYC taxi ride questions!? I CAN\'T LOSE MY DATA!!! What if I don\'t have time to figure out how many rides from Brooklyn to the airport happened?!\\"\\n\\nI couldn\'t bear not knowing! And [that\'s why I couldn\'t lose my data](/blog/why-i-couldnt-lose-my-data).\\n\\n:::tip[THE IDEA!]\\nWhat if I could create a UI that connects to ClickHouse, then self-host it on my own and have all the taxi data I wanted forever?!\\n:::\\n\\nWell, that\'s how CH-UI was born! \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n## What can you do with CH-UI?\\n\\nClearly, the main goal is to see all the taxi rides from Brooklyn to the airport... BUT if you want to do anything else, even though I don\'t see the point... You can:\\n\\n- Browse your databases and tables on the data explorer.\\n- Write and run queries with a nice SQL editor.\\n- View your data in tables, filter, sort, and export it.\\n- Get insights from your data much easier.\\n- See your instance metrics.\\n\\n## Final thoughts...\\n\\nI really hope this can be a true solution for anyone who wants to start with ClickHouse, or even for those who already **self-host** it and want a better way to interact with the data...\\n\\nI also hope that technical people who use CH-UI get involved in the project so it can grow to be better... Personally, I think data is extremely valuable for **EVERYONE**, not just big companies that can pay, or people who are starting to learn. I truly believe that we should be able to create solutions as a community, and I want to see all kinds of companies, professionals, and students using CH-UI and having a really good experience with it.\\n\\nSo, that\'s it for now! I hope you enjoy using CH-UI as much as I enjoyed creating it. And remember, if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to chat about ClickHouse, feel free to reach out! \ud83d\ude80"}]}}')}}]);
